I am a researcher at [VATT Institute for Economic Research](https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage) and a fifth-year PhD candidate in economics at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics) and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/). I am also affiliated with the [Finnish Centre of Excellence in Tax Systems Research (FIT)](https://verotutkimus.fi/en/home/).


I work mostly on public economics and especially on questions related to international corporate tax avoidance. I use administrative data and empirical methods to study the responses of corporations on (tax) regulation.
