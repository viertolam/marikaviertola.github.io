# Abstract
This paper studies how firms manipulate their transfer prices to shift profit from high tax countries to low tax countries. Using detailed product-destination level firm data for years 2013-2019, I find evidence of Finnish multinational enterprises underpricing their exports to low tax destinations. By exploiting variation in corporate income tax rate differences and differences in the ownership of affiliates, I apply a triple difference estimation strategy. I find that a 1 percentage point increase in tax rate difference decreases export unit value by 1.2% among multinational firms exporting to low tax countries. My results suggest firms use transfer pricing as a complement channel, as firms more prone to other profit shifting mechanisms also underprice their exports more. Also, I provide evidence that transfer mispricing is concentrated in exports destined to countries where the multinational’s affiliate has a higher level of economic activity. Where the results with exports are very robust, the results with imports are mixed, suggesting an asymmetrical pattern in transfer pricing.

# Effect of tax rate changes in low tax countries on the intra-firm export price
![Tax Rate Changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Taxratechanges_laji2.png)

The figure plots event study estimates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for three different type of tax changes happening in year 0 in the low tax country. After the low tax country has decreased it's corporate income tax rate (yellow and blue markers), the export unit value of a multinational that has an affiliate in that country decreases more compared to a firm that does not have any affiliates located in the country in question.
